To use range-byte requests, which are neccessary for many IGV file formats, we need a full-featured server.  Fortunately
we have one on MacOS (apache).  The following steps will enable the development html to be run from url
http://localhost/igv-web/dev/igv-dev.html.   This procedure was verified for MacOS 1.9.5.

Verify that Apache is running by typing "localhost" in the web browser.  If you get an error start it up from
a terminal like this

sudo apachectl start

The url http://localhost should now display a page.

Create a symboloic link to the project directory from the Apache home directory.  Modify the paths below as appropriate

cd /Library/WebServer/Documents
sudo ln -s /Users/jrobinso/projects/igv-web igv-web

Now http://localhost/igv-web/dev/igv-dev.html should bring up the app.  Likewise http://localhost/igv-web/<test file>.html will
run the unit tests.



Part 2 -- Enabling PHP
----------------------
PhP is neccessary to use the gene search function, and probably more stuff in the future.  To enable it
edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf  as root (e.g. sudo emacs /etc/apache2/httpd.conf)  and uncomment the line

#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

i.e. remove the # symbol.  Save and restart

sudo apachectl restart
